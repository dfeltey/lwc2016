@title[#:tag "racket-lwc"]{The Racket Language Workbench}

Racket promotes a language-oriented view of problem solving.
Using Racket, programmers can quickly build languages to solve
each aspect of a programming problem on its own linguistic terms.
As such, Racket programs are composed of a number of modules, each implemented
in the language that is best suited for the module's task.
To represent this moduleâ†’language mapping, the first line of each module
specifies the language in which it is written.
The Racket ecosystem relies on this mapping for @emph{linguistic dispatch}:
a mechanism by which a language publishes its
implementation and linguistic meta-information---syntax coloring,
indentation, static analysis, etc.---to
tailor the user experience for programs written in that language.

To support this language-development idiom, Racket fully embraces the
idea of @emph{linguistic reuse}@~cite[sk-dissertation]. According to this view,
the development of a new language consists of adding, subtracting, and
re-interpreting constructs and run-time facilities from a base language.
Even the installation of a new language takes place within the
Racket ecosystem: a language is itself a Racket component that provides
certain services, and each module's language specification (i.e., the initial @tt{#lang} line)
simply refers to another module that implements the language@~cite[you-want-it-when].

A language implementation can be as simple as a plain Racket module that
exports specific constructs. A more sophisticated language variant consists of modules that
implement a reader---a lexer and parser for any imaginable Unicode-based
notation---and a semantics module. By using specific tools and following
certain conventions, programmers can produce languages that work well
together.

More broadly, a programmer can implement a Racket language in several different ways:
@;
@itemlist[

@item{as a plain interpreter that repeatedly traverses the code of a client
program;}

@item{as a compiler that maps a client program to a target language, either
within or outside of the Racket ecosystem;} 

@; cite DVH's paper
@item{as a Redex@~cite[redex-book] reduction semantics; or}

@item{as a linguistic derivative of an existing Racket language.}

]
@;
Racket strongly encourages this last approach, because it delivers results
more quickly while remaining as general as any of the others.
But, all of these approaches are useful in
certain situations, and on occasion, as in the case of MiniJava, an
implementation may borrow elements from several approaches.

Deriving one language from another means creating a translation of new
linguistic constructs into those of the base (or ``parent'') language and a
run-time library. Such derivations inherit other elements of the run-time
system (the VM, the JIT compiler, the garbage collector, etc.). We consider construct
translation the critical part of language derivation.

Technically, the derivation works as follows. A language module may export
a subset of the constructs and functions of some base language, which
implicitly subtracts features from that language; it may export additional
features and functions, which adds new capabilities; and it may
re-interpret existing features, say, function applications or conditionals.
The re-interpretation is accomplished by defining a new construct or
function in a module and exporting it under the name of a feature that
already exists in the base language.

A Racket programmer uses the @defterm{syntax object system} to create new
linguistic constructs. This system is a
descendent of Scheme and Lisp's hygienic macro system@~cite[lisp-macros
hygienic-macros macros-that-work]. The system represents syntactic terms
via syntax objects, which include properties of the source syntax as well
as those specified by a language implementor
@~cite[syntactic-abstraction-in-scheme].

Like the Lisp macro system of lore, Racket's syntax object system allows
the specification of rewriting rules on syntax objects. An elaborator uses
these rules to translate a module from any language into Racket core syntax
on an incremental basis. Unlike Lisp or Scheme macros, Racket's rewriting
rules provide sophisticated services. For example, they automatically
propagate source information so that they can report error in terms of the
original @emph{source notation}. Similarly, the rules almost automatically
enforce context-free constraints so that error messages use the
@emph{concepts} of the surface language@~cite[fortifying-macros]. Lastly,
these rewriting rules can also articulate transformations on complete
modules and on existing linguistic constructs---giving them the expressive
power to track context-sensitive constraints and to assign new meaning to
old words.
